# About Me

My name is Wanjo Chan.  My thoughts are very random and even maybe meaningless.  I still collect them as some enlightment spark.

# Thoughts

* Quantum Mechanics => time-space-wave function solve the theory of things
* SaoLang => New Lang => then new OS
* Zerotier-like => make network nodes invisible again
* New browser that show your network+security status
